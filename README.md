I am an Electronics Engineer with a Master's degree in Metrology and Automation with more than 4 years of experience as a Data Scientist. I have work in numerous projects ranging from hardware prototyping for IoT to building a recommendation system with more than 100Gb of data.

I am a nerd that loves science. I love to explore complex themes and discover how far our knowledge has taken us. On the personal side, I really enjoy making friends, going to the beach, traveling to new places, and playing games.
